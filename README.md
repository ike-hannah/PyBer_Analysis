# PyBer Analysis
##Overview
Given ridesharing data from the PyBer app I created a new data frame merging data from diferent cities and individual ride data. Using this data, charts were created to get a better understanding of the differnces in the way the PyBer service opperates in differnt city environments. My main focus was on three city types "Urban", "Suburban", and "Rural". By creating a multiple line plot the differnce between the three types of city was easily visable.
