# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
Given ridesharing data from the PyBer app I created a new data frame merging data from diferent cities and individual ride data. Using this data, charts were created to get a better understanding of the differnces in the way the PyBer service opperates in differnt city environments. My main focus was on three city types "Urban", "Suburban", and "Rural". By creating a multiple line plot the differnce between the three types of city was easily visable. 
## Results

The results from the multi-line plot clearly show the urban demographic driving most of the revenue for PyBer

However from this breakdown of the city types we can see that (most likely due to longer ditances traveled) the fare per driver on average is much higher in rural cities. 
## Summary
From the analysis I would suggest a targeted ad push in 2 areas to balance the disparities between city types. 
* Advertize to new potential drivers in rural areas. The average fares are higher in these areas and an increase in number of driver per city would increase both revenue and usefulness of the PyBer service.
* In Suburban areas advertize the service to commuters. The number of people using the service is higher in suburban parts of cities as evidence by higher number of rides but if more people were using the service to commute the number would skyrocket.
* In rural areas, where the service is being used the most, a loyalty program could be implemented to encourage riders to use PyBer as much as possible to accrue points for free rides.
